# Interview Problems

This repository is for storing problems and solutions encountered during interviews.  
Most solutions are data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems in Java, but there may be text files with explanations, problem statements, or non-coding responses.

## Structure
- problems/java/ contains Java solutions to DSA problems.
- problems/text/ contains problem statements, notes, or textual explanations.
